# How-to install SimpleScalar on Ubuntu

# Using Docker

1. Build image by using `docker build . -t simplescalar`

2. Run the image as a Docker container: `docker run -ti simplescalar /bin/bash`

# Original Instructions

[SimpleScalar](http://www.simplescalar.com/) is a VLIW processor simulator. It allows to access measures like execution time, caches misses, and branch mis-prediction rates. It is entirely scalable: cache size and type, number of UAL entities, branch predictor types are customizable. It can be used as a tool for understanding Design-Space-Exploration. Unfortunately, the installation is a hassle due to an outdated code source.

The following script intends to automate the installation process with Ubuntu. It has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and gcc 4.6. It may not resolve all the errors you will have to face: don't hesitate to contribute if you think the script has to be improved. If you can choose not to use this simulator, you might want to take a glance at other simulators like [SoCLib](http://www.soclib.fr/) or [gem5](http://www.m5sim.org/). A more exhaustive list is available at [wikipedia (en)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture_simulator#Implementations)

## The script
install_simple_scalar.sh will create ~/simple_scalar, and install SimpleScalar in it.
Set the script as executable (chmod +x install_simple_scalar.sh), run it, this it it! You should be able to compile your first program using a command-line such as: "`sslittle-na-sstrix-gcc -x c++ main.c`"

## Miscellaneous
- gcc 2.6 does not accept inline comments with C. A simple workaround is to compile your C code as if it was a C++ code: use for instance `sslittle-na-sstrix-gcc -x c++ main.c`
- You might want to change some compilation flags in the SimpleScalar Makefile: Replace "`-O0`" by "`-O3 -march=native -fstrict-aliasing`" and removing the "`-DDEBUG`" flag gives a substantial speed gain (near x2.0)
- Dimensioning your architecture is always a trade off: Cache speed decreases with size. For a quantitative idea of the speed you can expect from a [cache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_%28computing%29), you might be interested by the tool [CACTI](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/cacti/), luckily far more simple to install than SimpleScalar.
